# *BASH-SCRIPTS*

This repository is a collection of bash scripts that I have made.

To play with any of the files here, simply clone the repository and run the scripts from bash. For example, to play Mastermind:

```$ git clone https://github.com/nelsonwalker/bash-scripts.git
$ cd bash-scripts/
$ ./mastermind.sh
```
